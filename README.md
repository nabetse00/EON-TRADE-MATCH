# Design

The trade system is designed with a single contract [Escrow.sol](./contracts/Escrow.sol).

This contract generates trades from user input.
It can be any of those types:

- Native Zen 
- ERC20 Tokens
- ERC721 NFTs

in any combination.

Contract matches trades and composes them. 
Meaning:
- if one user inputs a trade from ZEN to token A, another user form token A to token B
- contract creates a virtual trade from Zen to token B.

This process is recursive.

Please check source code for details.
